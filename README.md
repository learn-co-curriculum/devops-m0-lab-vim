# Vim tutor

## Task

The goal of this exercise is to become better acquainted with the `vim` CLI editor.

Luckily for us, many *Linux* distributions ship with a "tutor" for `vim`, known as `vimtutor`, out of the box.

To start the tutor, simply open your shell and run `vimtutor`! You should be met with the title screen, starting with something like:

```
===============================================================================
=    W e l c o m e   t o   t h e   V I M   T u t o r    -    Version 1.7      =
===============================================================================
```

From this point, the rest is self-explanatory. Just read all the text and perform the instructions given to you by the tutor.

## Submission

There is no deliverable for this exercise; the goal here is to get you acquainted with `vim` for some of the upcoming labs.
